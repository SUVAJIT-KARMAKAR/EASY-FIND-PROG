## PACKAGES AND MOUDLES

```bash
    npm install ejs
```

**EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating engine used in Node.js to generate dynamic HTML content by embedding JavaScript code within HTML templates. It allows you to pass data from the backend to the frontend, making it easy to display variables, iterate over data structures, and conditionally render content. EJS simplifies the process of creating reusable views by separating presentation logic from business logic, supporting partials and layouts to build modular and maintainable web pages. It’s widely used with Express for rendering HTML pages in server-side applications.**


```bash
    npm install nodemon
```

**Nodemon is a development tool for Node.js applications that automatically restarts the server whenever file changes are detected. This saves developers from manually restarting the server during the development process. It watches for updates in the project files and refreshes the application, streamlining the workflow and enhancing productivity. Nodemon is particularly useful for backend projects, where constant testing and modification are needed, as it significantly reduces time and effort. It’s easy to configure and can be run by replacing the standard `node` command with `nodemon` for automatic monitoring.**

```bash
    npm install express
```

**Express is a fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js, designed to build web applications and APIs. It simplifies server-side development by providing a robust set of features such as routing, middleware support, and HTTP request/response handling. Express allows developers to define routes for different HTTP methods, build RESTful services, and serve static files. Its lightweight structure provides flexibility, letting you easily integrate third-party middleware or write custom logic. Express is often used to create scalable and efficient backend applications, making it a popular choice for building web servers and microservices.**

```bash
    npm install mongoose
```

**Mongoose is an ODM used for interacting with MongoDB databases in Node.js. EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating engine that renders dynamic HTML. Nodemon automatically restarts the server during development upon detecting changes. Express is a web framework for building fast, flexible, and scalable backend applications.**

```bash
    npm install dotenv
```
**The `dotenv` package is a lightweight Python library used to manage environment variables by loading them from a `.env` file into your application's environment. This file typically contains key-value pairs that define configuration settings, such as API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive information. By using `dotenv`, developers can keep sensitive data secure, avoid hardcoding values in their codebase, and easily configure applications across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.**
